AI E-commerce is a technology store front featuring products generated by DALLÂ·E 2 AI. The store makes use of NEXT.js server-side rendering for fast load times and a headless CMS for making fast updates to products and page components. The shopping cart component utilizes  HTML 5 local storage for data persistence and keeps track of state using react hooks. Stripe integration provides a simple and fast checkout process for customers as well!
